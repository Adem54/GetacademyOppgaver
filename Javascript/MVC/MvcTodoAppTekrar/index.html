<!-- The model never touches the view. The view never touches the model. The controller connects them.
Neither the controller nor the model should know anything about the DOM, HTML elements, CSS, or any of that. Anything relating to it should be in the view.

Our first link between the view and model is to make a method that calls displayTodos every time a todo changes. We can also call it once in the constructor to display the initial todos if there are any.
