Now, when a web page is loaded, the browser creates such a document every time which is called, Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. In that hat way, programming languages connect to the webpage.
The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldnâ€™t be able to acess any of the web pages elements in HTML documents, XML documents or their component parts .
As per the W3C specification, one important objective for the Document Object Model is to provide a standard programming interface that can be used in a wide variety of environments and applications.

According to W3C, the document object model (DOM) is an "application programming interface for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated".

Whaaaaat? In simple terms, the DOM is a representation of your HTML to the browser and allows you to manipulate the page.
