 uestion 2: What is an Object?
   
   Answer: "Definition"
   
   Objects are Real-World Entities of OOP.
   A group of features can represent an Object.
   If anything is in Real World then that will be an Object.
   An Object can be Visible, Ideological or analytical.
   Variables are used to store an Objects Identity and State and Methods are used to show it's behavior.
   Examples of an Object are Pen, People, Table etc.

Objects have the following characteristics:
   
   State
   Behavior
   Identity
   Responsibility

1. State

The state of an object means the current values of all of its attribute, mainly the following two types of states.
1) Static state

Whose value doesn't change over a period of time.
2) Dynamic state

Whose value doesn't change over a period of time.
For Example:  Car
   
   A car is defined by:
   
   Color
   Average
   Power staric state
   Fuel type
   Speed
   Fuel level dynamic state
   Gear

2. Behavior

Behavior is how the object acts or reacts, in terms of state changes and operations performed on it.

For Example: Car

The behavior of a car is:

Open door
Close door
Change gear
Power on
Power off

3. Identity

Identity is how an object is identified.

For Example: Car

A car is identifying by:

Color
Number plate IDENTIFY CAR
Chassis number

4. Responsibility

Responsibility is the role of an object.

For example: Car

The role of a Car is:

To travel from one location to another.

A class is one of many items or collections. A class contains data members, member functions and access modifiers.
   A class is also a collection of objects.
   Several objects have a common state and behavior and thus can be grouped under a single class. For example, a Ford, a Honda, an Accent, and a Toyota can be grouped together under the class Car. Here, a Car is the class whereas Ford, Honda, Accent, Toyota are objects of the class Car.

The last and exciting example to understand class and objects is the mobile phone, which you can use many times in a day. As mobile is an object you can touch will make a class, and mobile phone belongs to company ‘Apple’ so we can see male Apple, a class in OOP. Mobile contains many Data members and Member functions such as Color, Price, Model No are, Data Members, and Call() and Video and Member Functions. You can quickly call any of these by using the class object in the main function.
